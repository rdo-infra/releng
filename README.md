# RDO Release Enginnering tools

This repo contains some utilities used in release management tasks in RDO project.

Following executable are provided in this repository:

- **new_releases**: list new releases tagged in OpenStack projects managed by release project
- **rdo_project**: list projects in RDO for releases and check branches status
- **reviews_rdo_project**: list existing reviews for projects in review.rdoproject.org
- **rdo_release_review**: automatically creates reviews to build new stable builds when
new releases are tagged upstream.

Directory `scripts` contains some bash scripts used for common tasks.

## Requirements

1. Install requirements listed in requirements.txt, see notes about binary requirements
2. Clone rdoinfo into ~/rdoinfo directory
3. Copy ssh private key used in review.rdoproject.org under ~/.ssh/
4. Configure .gitconfig to use the desired user when creating reviews (rdo_release_review) 
5. ssh review.rdoproject.org to add server key to known_hosts

**Not about using virtualenv:** rpm python module is not delivered via pypi so, if you plan
to use virtualenv to run rdo_release_review, add '--system-site-packages' option when creating
the virtualenv to use rpm module from the system.

## Usage examples:-

**rdo_release_review**
-  To see available options for running the script, run:-
   rdo_release_review --help

-  To run rdo_release_review against a upstream change, run:-
   # Replace <...> in below commands with a valid full or short commit hash, change-id or review id
   rdo_release_review -u rdo-trunk -c RDO -e dev@lists.rdoproject.org -r newton -n <reference review> --dry-run
   # For strict search for a commit or change-id, run:-
   rdo_release_review -u rdo-trunk -c RDO -e dev@lists.rdoproject.org -r newton -n commit:<commit-id> --dry-run
   rdo_release_review -u rdo-trunk -c RDO -e dev@lists.rdoproject.org -r newton -n change:<change-id> --dry-run

-  To run rdo_release_review against rdoinfo pin, run:-
   rdo_release_review -u rdo-trunk -c RDO -e dev@lists.rdoproject.org -r pike -p /home/$USER/rdoinfo --dry-run

-  Don't pass --dry-run if you want the script to send reviews to https://review.rdoproject.org

## TODO

1. Add custom location for rdoinfo in rdoutils/rdoinfo.py
2. Manage independent reviews in rdo_release_review
3. Add some unit tests
